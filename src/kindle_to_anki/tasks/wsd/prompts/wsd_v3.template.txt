Process the following {source_language_name} words and sentences.

Items to process:
{items_json}

For each item, output JSON with the following rule:

definition:
- Provide a concise {target_language_name} dictionary-style gloss (1–6 words preferred)
- The gloss MUST correspond to the LEMMA (base form), never the inflected surface form
- If the input word is plural, declined, conjugated, or otherwise inflected, normalize to the lemma before defining
- The gloss must reflect the meaning determined by the word's use in the given sentence
- Do NOT encode number, tense, case, or person in the gloss

Examples:
- input: "koty" → gloss should correspond to lemma "kot", not "cats"
- input: "szedłem" → gloss should correspond to lemma "iść", not "went"

Respond with valid JSON as a single object where:
- keys are the item UIDs
- values are objects with a single field: "definition"

No additional text. No explanations.
