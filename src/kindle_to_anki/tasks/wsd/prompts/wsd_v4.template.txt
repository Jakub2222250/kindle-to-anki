Process the following {source_language_name} words and sentences.

Items to process:
{items_json}

For each item, output JSON according to these rules:

**definition**
- Provide a concise {target_language_name} dictionary-style gloss for the LEMMA (base form), 1–6 words preferred
- The gloss must reflect the meaning required by the given sentence
- Do not encode tense, number, case, aspect, or person
- The gloss must be suitable for fast recall testing

**Optional nuance (same field)**
- If helpful, append a single semicolon (;) followed by brief nuance
- Nuance may indicate register, tone, or contrast with close synonyms
- Keep nuance very short (≈3–8 words)
- Omit nuance if it adds no learning value

**Normalization**
- If the input is inflected (plural, declined, conjugated), normalize to the lemma before defining

**Constraints**
- Text before the semicolon must stand alone as a correct recall answer
- Use at most one semicolon
- Avoid explanatory or descriptive phrasing
- Do not add examples or meta-language

**Output format**
Respond with a single JSON object where:
- Each key is an item's uid from the input
- Each value is an object with exactly one field: "definition"

Example input:
[
  {{"uid": "a1", "word": "pośladków", "lemma": "pośladek", "pos": "noun", "sentence": "Klepnął go w okolice pośladków."}},
  {{"uid": "b2", "word": "szedłem", "lemma": "iść", "pos": "verb", "sentence": "Szedłem bardzo wolno."}}
]

Example output:
{{
  "a1": {{"definition": "buttock; neutral, non-vulgar"}},
  "b2": {{"definition": "walk"}}
}}

No additional text. No explanations. Just the JSON object.
