Process the following {source_language_name} words and sentences. For each item, provide analysis in the specified format.

Items to process:
{items_json}

For each item, output JSON with:
1. definition: A concise {target_language_name} gloss (1-6 words preferred) of the lemma as used in context. Prioritize brevity for flashcard recall, but include enough detail to distinguish this sense from other common meanings.

Respond with valid JSON as an object where keys are the UIDs and values are the analysis objects. No additional text.
