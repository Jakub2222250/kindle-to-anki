Provide {source_language_name} definition hints for the following words.

Items to process:
{items_json}

For each item, provide a {source_language_name} definition of the lemma form (not the inflected input word), with the meaning determined by how the input word is used in the input sentence. Consider the part of speech when providing a concise dictionary-style gloss for the base form. The lemma word should be hidden in the hint.

Respond with valid JSON as an object where keys are the UIDs and values are objects with hint. No additional text.
