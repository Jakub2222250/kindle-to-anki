Generate concise {source_language_name} definition hints for the following words.

Items to process:
{items_json}

For each item, output a short {source_language_name} hint that:
- Describes the meaning of the LEMMA (base form), as determined by its use in the given sentence
- Is suitable for the FRONT of an Anki card (aim for ~3–8 words)
- Matches the part of speech of the lemma
- Uses singular, lemma-aligned phrasing when possible
- Does NOT contain the lemma, the inflected form, or obvious morphological variants
- Prefers simple, high-frequency words
- Avoids technical, scientific, or taxonomic terms unless unavoidable
- Avoids examples and explanatory phrasing; use dictionary-style wording only

Respond with valid JSON as a single object where:
- keys are the item UIDs
- values are objects with a single field: "hint"

No additional text.
