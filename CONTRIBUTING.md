# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Areas for Contribution

- **New vocabulary sources**: Implement alternatives to Kindle's vocab.db (e.g., Kobo, manual input, browser extensions)
- **Language support**: Add or improve language-specific LUI prompts in `tasks/lui/lui_prompts.py`
- **Alternative LLM providers**: Add new platforms in `platforms/`
- **Card templates**: Improve HTML/CSS in `anki/templates/`
- **Bug fixes and documentation**

## Development Setup

```bash
py -m pip install -e .
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

## Architecture Notes

The project uses a task/runtime pattern:
- **Tasks** (`tasks/`) define what needs to happen (translation, WSD, etc.)
- **Runtimes** implement how (OpenAI, DeepL, local LLM, etc.)
- **Platforms** (`platforms/`) wrap API clients

This modular architecture allows each processing step to use a different provider—including local LLMs if desired. The vocabulary source can also be swapped out if you want to use something other than Kindle.

Each task has a cache to avoid redundant API calls during development.
